This is a small graphic project to learn how to work with windows and handle events.
Example of the result you can see in attached picture.
This is a map bounded by a wall. Using the WASD buttons or arrows, you can move the character along it. If you collect all collectibles, the exit will open. If you move to it, the window will close. If you touch the enemies, the window will close. Same if you press ESC.

If you want to try it, clone repository.
